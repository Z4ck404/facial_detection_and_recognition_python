# facial_detection_and_recognition_python
facial detection and recognition with python 
instead of extracting all the distances between the 68 points as measures , I added the ratios too 
means adding to the measures dist(a,c)/dist(a,b) where a ,b and c are distint points and that will give in the end an encoding of more than 4k measure for each face .
